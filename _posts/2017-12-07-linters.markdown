Linter is any tool that detects and flags errors in programming languages, including stylistic errors. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))

My favorite linters for various tasks:
* Ansible: [ansible-lint](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-lint)
* JavaScript: [prettier-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-standard)
* Puppet: [puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com/)
* Python: [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/)
* Ruby: [rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Terraform: `terraform fmt`
